# udacity-clouddeveloper-capstone
Capstone project for the Udacity Cloud Developer Nanodegree


## Project description
This project is an image sharing application, similar to Udagram from the lecture, but with a twist:

There is which tells the user what object is displayed in the image.
This can be used 

## Authentication

webp does not work for JIMP

Can take a while for image to appear in Frontend (refresh)

Reddit style app (everyone can see but only logged in user can post)

### Model
Model has 133 classes ...

## Deployment
Why two different sections and not one serverless.yaml

## Improvements
Lambda coldstart for model, look into smaller models ONNX Runtime
Allow user to delete images
