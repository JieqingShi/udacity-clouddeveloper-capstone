# NOTE: USE NODE 14 WITH THE MOST RECENT VERSION OF SERVERLESS
# WITH NODE 12 THE DEPLOYMENT DOES NOT WORK - REASON:
    # in node12, not specifying the 'handler' in 'functions' raises an error during deployment, that the 'handler' is missing
    # however adding the handler seems to replace the specified docker image!
    # Namely, after deployment the lambda function is not connected
    # to the image, it's just the uploaded code that cannot run due to the missing dependencies!
    # In node14 the behavior is actually correct - specifying both 'image' and 'handler' raises an error
   # that only one of the two is allowed to be specified)!
